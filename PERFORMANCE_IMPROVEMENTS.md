# Performance Improvements

This document outlines the performance improvements made to the WynnVentory Web application.

## 1. MongoDB Connection Pooling

**File:** `modules/db.py`

**Description:**
- Implemented connection pooling for MongoDB to reuse connections instead of creating new ones for each request
- Added global client instances for both admin and current databases
- Set maxPoolSize to 50 to handle concurrent connections efficiently

**Benefits:**
- Reduces connection overhead
- Improves response time for database operations
- Reduces resource usage on both client and server

## 2. API Response Caching

**File:** `modules/routes/api/wynncraft_api.py`

**Description:**
- Implemented an in-memory caching mechanism with TTL (time-to-live) values
- Added caching for all Wynncraft API calls with appropriate TTL values:
  - Item database: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
  - Search results: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
  - Individual item data: 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
  - Aspect data: 30 minutes (1800 seconds)

**Benefits:**
- Reduces the number of external API calls
- Improves response time for frequently requested data
- Reduces load on the Wynncraft API
- Provides resilience against Wynncraft API outages

## 3. Fixed Recursion Issue

**File:** `modules/routes/api/item.py`

**Description:**
- Fixed a potential recursion issue in the item search endpoint
- Updated the route handler to correctly call the service function

**Benefits:**
- Prevents stack overflow errors
- Ensures correct functionality of the item search endpoint

## 4. Request Timeouts

**File:** `modules/routes/api/wynncraft_api.py`

**Description:**
- Added timeouts to all external API calls (10 seconds)
- Added specific exception handling for timeout errors

**Benefits:**
- Prevents hanging requests if the Wynncraft API is slow to respond
- Improves user experience by failing fast instead of waiting indefinitely
- Frees up server resources that would otherwise be tied up in waiting for responses

## 5. Flask Application Optimizations

**File:** `app.py`

**Description:**
- Added performance optimizations:
  - Enabled JSON compact mode to reduce response size
  - Enabled threaded mode for better concurrency

**Benefits:**
- Reduces response size and improves network performance
- Improves concurrency and request handling
- Optimizes resource usage

## Future Recommendations

1. **Implement proper logging**: Replace print statements with a structured logging system
2. **Add database indexing**: Analyze query patterns and add appropriate indexes
3. **Implement rate limiting**: Protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage
4. **Add monitoring**: Implement performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks
5. **Consider using a production WSGI server**: Replace the development server with Gunicorn or uWSGI in production
